When we add the edge (u,v) to the minimum spanning tree T, it creates a unique path from vertex u to vertex v in T. Since T is a tree, there is only one path between any two vertices. By adding (u,v) to T, we create a new edge between two vertices that already have a path between them in T. This new edge creates a cycle by connecting the endpoints of the existing path.

To remove an edge from T and form a cycle, we can simply remove any edge from the unique path between u and v in T. This will disconnect the tree and create a cycle that includes (u,v). Because T is a tree, it has exactly one fewer edges than vertices. Therefore, removing any edge from T will create a new tree with one less edge, and this new tree must be a cycle.

So, by adding (u,v) to T and removing an edge e from T to form a cycle, we obtain a new tree T' that includes (u,v) and has the same number of edges as T.
