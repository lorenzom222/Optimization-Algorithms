Bottom-up DP:
* When the problem has a well-defined base case or cases that can be solved directly.
* When the subproblems can be solved independently of each other and have no interdependencies.
* When the solution to the problem depends only on the solutions to the subproblems.

Top-down DP:
* When the problem has a recursive structure that can be broken down into smaller subproblems.
* When the subproblems are interdependent and the solution to one subproblem depends on the solutions to others.
* When the problem has an exponential number of subproblems, and a memoization technique can be used to avoid recomputing the same subproblems multiple times.
